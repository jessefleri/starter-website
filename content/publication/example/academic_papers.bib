	abstract = {The Global Vegetation Project (http://gveg.wyobiodiversity.org) is a new initiative to host an online database of open-access, georeferenced vegetation photos. The mission of the Global Vegetation Project is ‘to inspire and empower people of all ages to learn about the diversity of vegetation on our planet and to provide educators with a resource for teaching ecology online’. The beta release includes two R-Shiny web applications that allow users to 1) submit photos of plant communities through a user-friendly online portal and 2) explore submissions made by others through an interactive global map. The spatial coordinates of each photo are used to extract information about the location including long-term and recent climate data to create Walter and Leith climate diagrams for each photo. User submitted photos can be filtered by biome, temperature, precipitation, and elevation on the map. The Global Vegetation Project will evolve to match the needs of vegetation scientists and ecology educators. We intend to enhance the educational value of the mapping application by incorporating additional search features, global data layers, and the publication of curricula geared towards primary, secondary, and post-secondary education. We encourage the global community of vegetation scientists to use this resource in their classrooms and to contribute photos of vegetation to grow this valuable resource for the world.},

	abstract = {Aquatic insects exhibit complex life cycles that include egg, larval, adult, and, in some instances, pupal stages. Disturbances at any of these life stages can affect overall population dynamics. Yet, efforts to understand the effects of disturbances, such as hydrologic alterations, overwhelmingly focus on the larval life stage of aquatic insects. We evaluated the potential for load-following flows associated with hydroelectric power production to act as a population bottleneck for aquatic insects via reductions in the availability and temporal persistence of optimal oviposition habitats. Specifically, we quantified the oviposition habitat selectivity of Baetis spp. (Baetidae), Brachycentrus occidentalis (Brachycentridae), Chironomidae (Diptera), and Hydropsyche occidentalis (Hydropsychidae) downstream of Flaming Gorge Dam, Utah, USA. We found that all taxa except H. occidentalis preferentially laid eggs on large emergent substrates located along the river edge. Peak discharge associated with load-following flows substantially reduced the number of emergent substrates available for oviposition, and daily low flows exposed eggs in these habitats to desiccation and drying. When subjected to experimental drying, both Baetis and H. occidentalis eggs experienced nearly 100\% mortality after 2 h, whereas most B. occidentalis remained viable after 8 h. Our paired field and experimental results are consistent with the hypothesis that load-following flows from hydroelectric dams produce a population bottleneck for aquatic insects by short circuiting recruitment processes. Environmental flows that seek to improve the health of tailwater aquatic insect populations would benefit from consideration of habitat requirements for all life stages of aquatic insects.},

	abstract = {Tidal marshes form at the confluence between estuarine and marine environments where tidal movement regulates their developmental processes. Here, we investigate how the interplay between tides, channel morphology, and vegetation affect sediment dynamics in a low energy tidal marsh at the Paul S. Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration Project at Poplar Island. Poplar Island is an active restoration site where fine-grained material dredged from navigation channels in the upper Chesapeake Bay are being used to restore remote tidal marsh habitat toward the middle bay (Maryland, USA). Tidal currents were measured over multiple tidal cycles in the inlets and tidal creeks of one marsh at Poplar Island, Cell 1B, using Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) to estimate water fluxes throughout the marsh complex. Sediment fluxes were estimated using acoustic backscatter recorded by ADCPs and validated against total suspended solid measurements taken on site. A high-resolution geomorphic survey was conducted to capture channel cross sections and tidal marsh morphology. We integrated simple numerical models built in Delft3d with empirical observations to identify which eco-geomorphological factors influence sediment distribution in various channel configurations with differing vegetative characteristics. Channel morphology influences flood-ebb dominance in marshes, where deep, narrow channels promote high tidal velocities and incision, increasing sediment suspension and reducing resilience in marshes at Poplar Island. Our numerical models suggest that accurately modelling plant phenology is vital for estimating sediment accretion rates. In-situ observations indicate that Poplar Island marshes are experiencing erosion typical for many Chesapeake Bay islands. Peak periods of sediment suspension frequently coincide with the largest outflows of water during ebb tides resulting in large sediment deficits. Ebb dominance (net sediment export) in tidal marshes is likely amplified by sea-level rise and may lower marsh resilience. We couple field observations with numerical models to understand how tidal marsh morphodynamics contribute to marsh resilience. © 2019 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Non-native earthworms can alter ecosystems by modifying soil structure, depredating seeds and seedlings, and consuming soil organic matter, yet the initial responses of plant communities to earthworm invasions remain poorly understood. We assessed the effect of non-native earthworms on seedling survival during germination and after establishment using six native and six non-native plant species grown from seed in single- and multi-species experimental mesocosms. We examined the extent to which earthworms (1) influenced seedling survival, (2) selectively depredated native versus non-native plants, (3) impacted establishment based on seed size and/or root morphology, and (4) shaped community assembly. The effect of earthworms on seedling survival varied temporally and among species but inconsistently with respect to species origin. Differences in seed/seedling survival translated to changes in community assembly. Earthworms tended to reduce species abundance, richness, evenness, and diversity in multi-species mesocosms and led to the divergence of communities by treatment. In general, species with large seeds and fibrous roots dominated communities with earthworms present, whereas species with small seeds and taproots only persisted in multi-species mesocosms without earthworms. Our findings suggest that earthworms act as ecological filters in the early stages of invasion to shape community composition based on plant morphological traits.},

	abstract = {Biological invasions by cryptic ecosystem engineers can alter the ecological and socio-economic values of ecosystems in ways that may take decades to detect. The invasion of North American glacial refuges by non-native earthworms offers a prominent but understudied example of a cryptic invasion. Non-native earthworms are known to alter carbon sequestration, disrupt mycorrhizal networks and homogenize plant communities, but natural resource managers still lack robust protocols to identify and safeguard high conservation value communities (HCVCs) from such invasions. In the absence of such protocols, or reliable methods to eradicate non-native earthworm populations once established, there is an urgent need for methods to identify HCVCs at risk of or potentially shielded from earthworm invasion by the existence of abiotic barriers to their dispersal or persistence in such sites. We developed species distribution models (SDMs) using in situ field surveys and remotely sensed data to (1) identify factors limiting the occurrence of non-native Lumbricus earthworms in imperilled coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forest and Garry oak (Quercus garryana) and maritime meadow ecosystems endemic to glacial refugia of the Pacific Northwest of North America and to (2) evaluate their influence on plant species diversity and identify abiotic factors capable of preventing their dispersal or persistence at a site. As predicted, shallow, drier soils and steeper terrain limited earthworm occurrence and abundance in our highly heterogeneous study area, and earthworm presence appeared to reduce plant species richness. Our results indicated that HCVCs endemic to shallow-soil ({\textless} 12 ± 3 cm) sites that experience regular summer drought appear to act as refuges from invasion by non-native earthworms. Our results also elevate concerns for the conservation of deep-soil habitats not isolated from earthworm invasions by shallow soil, saltwater or other barriers to earthworm dispersal. The SDMs developed here offer guidance to the identification of potential refuges for the conservation of imperilled native species and communities from the detrimental effects non-native earthworms in glacial refugia of western North America and should thereby facilitate proactive planning by conservation practitioners.},
